## Security Best Practices for Contributors

### Code Security Guidelines

1. **Input Validation**
   ```javascript
   // ✅ Good: Validate all inputs
   const schema = Joi.object({
     email: Joi.string().email().required(),
     password: Joi.string().min(8).pattern(/^(?=.*[a-z])(?=.*[A-Z])(?=.*\d)(?=.*[@$!%*?&])[A-Za-z\d@$!%*?&]/)
   });
   
   // ❌ Bad: No validation
   const email = req.body.email;
   ```

2. **SQL Injection Prevention**
   ```csharp
   // ✅ Good: Parameterized queries
   var users = context.Users.Where(u => u.Email == email).ToList();
   
   // ❌ Bad: String concatenation
   var query = $"SELECT * FROM Users WHERE Email = '{email}'";
   ```

3. **Authentication & Authorization**
   ```csharp
   // ✅ Good: Proper authorization
   [Authorize(Roles = "User,Admin")]
   [HttpGet]
   public async Task<IActionResult> GetTasks()
   
   // ❌ Bad: No authorization check
   [HttpGet]
   public async Task<IActionResult> GetTasks()
   ```

4. **Error Handling**
   ```javascript
   // ✅ Good: Safe error handling
   try {
     // operation
   } catch (error) {
     logger.error('Operation failed', { userId, operation: 'createTask' });
     return res.status(500).json({ message: 'Operation failed' });
   }
   
   // ❌ Bad: Exposing internal errors
   catch (error) {
     return res.status(500).json({ message: error.message });
   }
   ```

### Environment Security

1. **Environment Variables**
   - Never commit secrets to version control
   - Use environment-specific configuration files
   - Rotate secrets regularly

2. **Dependencies**
   - Keep dependencies updated
   - Use `npm audit` and `dotnet list package --vulnerable`
   - Remove unused dependencies

3. **Docker Security**
   ```dockerfile
   # ✅ Good: Non-root user
   RUN addgroup -g 1001 -S nodejs
   RUN adduser -S nextjs -u 1001
   USER nextjs
   
   # ❌ Bad: Running as root
   # (no USER directive)
   ```
